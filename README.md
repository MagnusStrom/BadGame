# BadGame
A bad game that I wrote cuz I'm learning haxe. I might update it IDK.

TO RUN: download all the fancy shmancy lime and haxe stuff, then run it with `lime test html5`, `lime test mac`, not sure if it runs on windows lawl

HOW TO PLAY: You're the grey cube, avoid the red lines to get points
